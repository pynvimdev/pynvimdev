# Hello Folks,
My name is Hari and I am a Student who writes code based on India. I write some code, maintain some good projects like YCM(YouCompleteMe) and COC(Conqueror Of Completeion) 
which is currently losing popularity after the release of LSP for Neovim.


# Projects

- Check my Neovim based IDE
https://github.com/pynvimdev/Solarvim

# What do i do ?
Create some good python projects and vim plugins. I also write some extra comments in the source code of forked projects so that you can understand what the code does

# WorkFlow(example with Neovim and tmux)
